**# Project Overview**
You are building a EV Owners application that allows users to track their EV charging costs, find nearby charging stations, and log trips.

You will be using NextJS 14, ShadCN, TailwindCSS, Typescript, Firebase, and Firebase Storage.

**# Core Functionalities**
1. Dashboard:
   - Display summary statistics: total energy charged, average cost, total trips, etc.
   - Show recent charging sessions and trips
   - Implement a widget for optimal charging time recommendations

2. Charge Tracking:
   - Create a form for manual entry of charging sessions (date, time, location, energy added, cost)
   - Display a list/table of past charging sessions with sorting and filtering options
   - Implement a chart showing charging costs over time

3. Trip Logging:
   - Develop a form for logging trips (start/end locations, date, distance, energy used)
   - Show a list of past trips with relevant statistics
   - Create a map view of logged trips (if time permits)

4. Charger Map:
   - Integrate a map view (consider using Leaflet.js or Google Maps)
   - Display charging stations as markers on the map
   - Implement a list view of nearby chargers with filtering options
   - Allow users to view detailed information about each charger

5. Profile:
   - Create a profile page where users can view and edit their information
   - Implement a form for adding and managing vehicle information
   - Display user-specific statistics and achievements
